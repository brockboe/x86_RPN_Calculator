# x86_RPN_Calculator
A simple x86 RPN calculator as an example assembly program mixed with C

This is a personal project I created over the summer of 2018 to teach myself x86 assembly. The
code mixes C, which is used for grabbing user input from the command line, and x86, which is 
used for the actual processing of the data. The RPN calculator is stack based and pretty
bare bones, so segfaults can occur regularly if bad inputs are given.
